2. try to memorise all (you got about 10 seconds)

3. then the game begins, all the lights turns off, and now you can press the buttons down side of the screen (there are 9 of it)

4. each button controls two lights, press it to either turn on or turn off the lights

5. you have to make sure you turned on the same lights as the begining state, if you do, you win

6. after 30 seconds of the game begins, a ghost will shows up in the end of the corridor, 15 seconds later, it trys to move toward you

7. if the ghost touchs you (which means, after 60 seconds of the game begins), you lose

8. you can long press the screen in the game time, a snapshot of the correct turned on light position will shows up in the upper-right corner of the screen, it would helps you a lot
