# Light-On

A game with logic training and some creepy images

Rules:
1. In the begining of the game, six lights will turn on, and each of it is in random position

2. try to memorise all (you got about 10 seconds), if you turned on the same light as the beginning state, you win(and other lights besides them should been turned off)

3. then the game begins, all the lights turns off, and now you can press the buttons down side of the screen (there are nine buttons)

4. each button controls two lights, press it to either turn on or turn off the lights

5. 30 seconds after, a ghost will pop up in the end of the corridor, 15 seconds later, it trys to move toward you

6. if the ghost touchs you (which means, after 60 seconds of the game begins), you lose

7. you can long press the screen in the game time, a snapshot of the correct turned on light position will shows up in the upper-right corner of the screen, it would helps you a lot
